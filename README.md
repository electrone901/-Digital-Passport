# Digital Passport



### TLDR of the Proposal:

Wouldn't it be cool and convenient to have all the places that you have visited in your hands? With NFT Passport you can collect and display unique local NFTs from the comfort of your hands.
Every time that you visit a country, a city, or a place you can buy, collect or get for free NFTs. Especially when you participate in activities within local communities that support its local economy, such as visiting local places, museums, monuments, eating at local restaurants, or buying goods from local makers.

Every community will decide what is important to them and how to reward their visitors. They can choose to provide free or very low price NFTs as a way of souvenirs giving travelers the opportunity to collect and display unique local NFTs.
This will stimulate traveling, the global economy and it will give travelers the opportunity to have all their trips in one digital app. Where they can look back and trace their travels by looking at their NFTs on a global map. Every NFT will display helpful information about the place and about the NFT itself such as the date and time.

NFT Passport will work in association with local governments, communities, and creators to establish where NFTs can be collected by travelers and what their unique design will be.


NFT Passport will be a marketplace platform where NFTs are minted and ready to be collected by travelers. To obtain an NFT, travelers will scan a QR code using their phone, then they will be redirected to our platform where they can purchase the NFT from the community.




  All proceeds go directly back to the municipality to fund identified local initiatives. The traveller has just collected an NFT that is displayed on their personal Digital Passport in Souvenir, a dedicated platform where travelers can open their NFT collection as a travel book and fill it by collecting more NFTs!
